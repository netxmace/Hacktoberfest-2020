#### A dash across your keyboard 🎹 ,  
#### A well declared loop 🌀 ,   
#### A whisper of C  🌝   and Python  🐍   encrypt  
#### Or maybe a little JavaScript 🧠 
#### Print, or scan, or continue, or break 🤹🏻‍♀️,  
#### Find your hack, Coders awake 🧞‍♂️ !  

Its that time of year again! And this time **NetX**, MACE’s very own **Open Source Club**, is bringing home a fan favourite. **Hackoctober** is here, and we’re excited to join the fun, with 3 repos open and waiting for your contribution. Wondering what exactly Hackoctober and how it works? Worry not, we got you!  

[ Okay 👀 That was more poetic than we expected it to be!]

So...in simple words, in language of normal humans...We were talking about how you can contribute! 👇🏻

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### How to contribute ?

#### => MAKE SURE YOU'RE IN!

**Step 1:** Login to your **GitHub account** and register for Hacktoberfest. [ Don't have one? It's time you make it..Run 🏃🏻‍♂️ ] 

**Step 2:** Pick any repository of your choice [ Public ones and yeah we've some set for you!😉 ].  

**Step 3:** What are you waiting for? 👨🏻‍💻 **Start contributing** 👩🏻‍💻.  

Once you have signed up, you can **check your progress on the Hacktoberfest website.**  

#### => Here are a few steps for making your first PR:  

**Step 1:** Choose any repository available on GitHub. You can search with the tag “hactoberfest”. 

**Step 2:** Check for the issues present in that repository or raise an issue if required. ( We learn by doing 😄 ) 

**Step 3:** Check whether you’re able to solve the chosen issue with your technical skills or not. ( Trust me, there'll always be something you can solve. You just have to set your mind to it.)
        
**Step 4:** If yes, fork the repository into your own GitHub profile and if not, search for another repository, until you get an issue which can be resolved. 

**Step 5:** Make the required changes to resolve the issue and commit it.  

**Step 6:** You can now **raise a PR.**  
  
You can check your dashboard for getting the updates of your raised PRs. If your PR is good enough to be considered for the challenge, it’ll be counted. Or else, if you are raising the PR from a spam repository or if your PR doesn’t meet the Hacktoberfest quality standards, then it will be flagged.🏴
